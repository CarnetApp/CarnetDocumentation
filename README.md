## Introduction

QuickDoc is a complete and rich note taking app for Android and Linux with sync capabilities
Be aware that this is still a beta version, I recommand not using Google Drive for now (NextCloud works perfectly)

## Features

- Import from Google Keep (only on desktop, then sync on mobile)
- Insert images / review
- Open HTML format
- Organize with folders and choose root storage folder depending on your needs
- Keywords
- Quickly see your recent notes
- Search amount your notes
- Protect the app with a pin code (won't encrypt notes) on android
- Statistics : words/sentences/characters
- Sync with Google Drive and NextCloud
